               <h1>Welcome to the Alternion Wiki About page!</h1>
               This page will go over the reason why this made was made, how it got to it's current stage, and what the mod does.

               <h2 id="Features">What the mod does</h2>

               The mod has many features, all based off of user steamID64 and so replicate across all clients that run the mod, even if you yourself are not running the mod.<br>
               Here is a list of all the currently implemented features:

               <ul>
                  <li>Custom Badges</li>
                  <li>Custom Sails</li>
                  <li>Custom Weapons</li>
                  <li>Custom Cannons</li>
               </ul> 

               <h2 id="Backstory">Backstory</h2>

               This is a split off from my first mod which was initially created for custom badges and outfits. That one allowed for a user to use a local file to assign badges to players, and replace outfits. Sadly however this wasn't replicated across all mod users. Hence why this was made. The original mod can still be found on my github through the following link, it is however no longer supported and so will not work fully as intended.<br>

               <br>
               The original goal was simply to modify and allow for custom badges. This became possible with the 1.0 release on 11 August 2020. It used a single server txt file that had a layout of <code>STEAMID64=SkinName</code>. It simply stored them as a string, and each time you pressed tab to view the scoreboard, it would loop over the list for each user, and find if they were in the list or not, if they were then it would load the relevant image from the file. This of course however, isn't the best method to use, and naturally involved no caching of any form.<br>
               <br>
               Version 1.1 which came out the following day fixed a few issues that I had found from initial release. The main focus however was that there was now the option of choosing whether or not you wanted to over-ride Tournamwent Wake badges. For reference these badges are given to the winners of each Tournament wake, a community held tournament that occurs roughly once every six months. Unfortunatley as I was still rather new to C# and unity at the time, rather than make a keybind for it, I simply provided two <code>.dll</code>'s, one which always displayed the custom badges, and one that wouldn't override if it was a TW winner.<br>
               <br>
               On the 25th of August the same year, (14 days later) I rolled out my first attempt at weapon skins with <code>version 2.0</code>. (Little did I know that they didn't really work at all). They used the same list based system as the custom badges did, however of course long term, this was a rather dumb idea.<br>
               <br>
               Version 3.0 came out on October 3rd, adding support for custom sail skins bas off the captain. It operated in much the same way as previous two additions, using a single remote txt file with a list of steamIDs and skin names. Whenever the sail got first spawned it would loop over the player list (for each sail) and try to find which skin it should apply to. The main issue with this method however, is both A) It's really slow and laggy B) Because the game pools sails and ships, it only ever runs the first time that sail gets made, and so the sail will keep showing with that skin, until you restart your game. Not ideal.<br>
               <br>
               The following day version 4.0 was released, with the primary function being that it added cannon skins, based off the captains steamID and equipped skin. Unfortunatley however, this did not quite go to plan with it sometimes not applying, and of course, the cannons not resetting for a new captain. This update also marks the point that I started to provide all the required files in the release (<b>BWModLoader.dll</b>,<b>0Harmony.dll</b> and the modified <b>Assembly-CSharp.dll</b>).<br>
               <br>
               With the release of version 4.1 on Oct 5th, I finally started to cache badge textures, this lead to a significant performance improvement whenever the scoreboard was updated and/or viewed. This system although alot faster, was still somewhat slow as I was simply using another list of badge textures. This also meant that I was storing the same badge several times, something that wouldn't be fixed until I later learnt about Dictionaries in C#<br>
               <br>
               I further added more texture caching later on in the same day with version 4.2. This meant that weapon skins and cannon skins were now also being cached, albeit using the same bad list system I used int v4.1<br>
               <br>
               When version 4.3 was released on Oct 9th, I had learnt about dictionaries and set about implementing them into the mod.It took a while but I converted over the badge textures, sail textures and cannon textures to use a single dictionary each, rather than a list. However the player ID's and skin names were still stored inside lists, which did mean there was an extra for loop required still.<br>
               <br>
               The release of version 4.4 onthe 16th of October meant that mainsails were now individually supported, meaning you could have one skin apply to most of your sails, but have the mainsail be a different skin all together. The download process was also smoothed out significiantly, with a list containing the previously downloaded files ensuring that files only got downloaded once even if several people had the same item equipped.<br>
               <br>
               18th October was a small micro patch (v4.4.1) which added support for custom badges to show up in the showcase that happens after a round end.<br>
               <br>
               Release 4.5 came with ship caching on the 23rd, to allow easier modification of the objects post initial activation. I also fixed an issue with the mainsails that had gone un-noticed until the day before (sneaky little typos!). Resetting textures on round end was also implemented in this update, so that ships were no longer stuck with the same sails/cannons until you restarted the game. This was made possible by the caching of the ship itself. It was also a release to attempt the a fix at cannon skins and sail skins not properly being switched out or removed after a new captain took over for the round, but it still had a few issues in that aspect.<br>
               <br>
               During the process of 4.5 I had however made a rather large blunder, and left the code that manages the badges, inside the wrong <code>try{} catch(){}</code> segment, leading to issues where it wouldn't display the badges correctly or just not at all.<br>
               <br>
               Version 5.0, which got released on 9th of november, was a big step forwards. It fixed bugs with the weapon skins not working in 1st or 3rd person mode, cannon skins not showing on working cannons (only on destroyed ones), the KS badge no-longer over-write it in the main menu when toggling between KS or custom, a modification to the way the Modloader was called fixed an issue that occured where it would start a new instance each time you returned to the main menu (as it was an <b>Assembly-CSharp.dll</b> modification, the dll is compatible with any mod), and for weapon skins, it now applied your current musket skin onto the main menu character, as well as correctly displaying your custom badge when returning to the main menu. It was also the first version that released the config menu, which lets you tweak every aspect of the mod during runtime, some would require a roundend if you disabled them <b>after</b> they had already taken effect, for example the sail skins or cannon skin. Weapon skins would require the other player to respawn but badges are instant. A downloading UI was also added to the startup phase, allowing you to see how far in the asset fetching stage you were, and helped prevent people joining a server before the mod was finished setting everything up. Caching was reworked to have a single playerObject Dictionary, which contained everything about the player, rather than 8 (or so) different lists with 4 dicts. Whilst not fixing the issue with duplicate caching of data, it was the first step into a more efficient fetching system, as I also reworked the way that data was gathered. Instead of using 4-5 different remote .txt files to look over, all players were now stored within a single <code>playerList.json</code> file, which was alot easier to maintain<br>
               <br>
               The release of 6.0 on the 1st of decemeber again brought along with it, alot of changes. Most notibly it added integration with oliverbot. This meant that if the players steamID was linked locally in my database to their discordID, they could change their equipment through Oliverbot in discord. This was a big step as it meant I finally no longer had to manually assign everyone their items for things like events. I would still have to manually register players and enter new items into the system however. It also added the ability for players to "Save" their current config options to a config file <b>Alternion.cfg</b>, and added the option to disable downloading of assets on startup. The downside to setting downloadOnStartup to false is that it will not downlaod any new assets at all, until you re-enable it, which can lead to compatibility issues later on down the line. Another BIG rework was the creation of the class <code>TheBigCacher</code>, it meant that textures were only ever cached once, making duplicates impossible, and made everything in one single place. Individual weapon skins were also added, this meant you could have a different skin applied to your musket than to your pistol for example, where previously it was one set for all weapons. This however required reworks to the json, so version 5.0 users would no longer get updates to their setups. Support for versions 4.X and below were also ended as the .txt files they fetched from got removed. As there were still some issues with cannon skins not resetting or not applying properly they were set to disabled by default, but could still be enabled if you wished.<br>
               <br>
               At the time of writing version 7.0 is currently in development, but is already available as a pre-release. It adds support for updating users during runtime (on server join), but it'll only work if you already have the required textures cached from startup. This is because currently it is fully multithreaded, and I cannot create new texture2D's from child threads. The config menu also recieved a slight rework and got a 3rd page, with options to force an update for players, toggle downloading on startup and toggling the runtime updates. The forwards and backwards buttons now also only show if you are not on the last or first page respectivley. It also comes with support for more types of skins: tea, rum and bucket, as well as fixing the dagger + cutlass and rapier + axe skins, which were because they share the same alb file. It also allows you to disable the watermark each startup from the config menu.<br>
