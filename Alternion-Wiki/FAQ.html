                  <summary>Do I have to manually install/update any textures when new things get added?</summary>

                     No! The mod automatically fetches textures based off of what others and you have equipped at the time of starting up your game. Currently this means if anything is changed after you startup it won't show for you, so I plan to modify this in future if the mod gains enough traction for it to be noticable. All textures will be downloaded once the downloading indicator in the centre of your screen vanishes.<br>
                     <br>
                     If you wish to stop downloading the currently equipped items then you can disable the option called <code>downloadOnStartup</code>, which can be found on the third page of the config menu.<br>

                     Create an issue on the Github repo, and I will look at it as soon as I can, or alternatively contact me on discord <b>Archie the inventor#4744</b>.

                  <summary>Will other people see my loadout as well as me?</summary>

                     For anyone else using the mod, Yes! All loadouts show for everyone on that server that also has the mod installed, as long as you didn't change your items after they started up their game. There is also support for updating users as they join their game, this however is currently still somewhat experimental.

                  <summary>Do I have to run the mod for others to see my items?</summary>
                     Nope! Anyone using the mod will see your equipped items, whether you have it installed yourself or not!

                  <summary>How do I access the configuration menu?</summary>
                     The default keybind is <b>"]"</b>, it can be rebound in the <b>AlternionConfig.cfg</b> file, located in <b>common\Blackwake\AlternionConfig.cfg</b>. This file will also contain all the default settings with which you will startup each time. Any changes made ingame will not save to the config file <b>UNLESS</b> you click save in the config menu.
