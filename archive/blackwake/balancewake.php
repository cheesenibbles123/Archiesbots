    							<b>Open invitation to “Yellow’s BalanceWake”</b><br>
								Ahoy salty seadogs! I hereby officially invite you all to the first(but far from last) BalanceWake Tournament.<br>
								<br>
								<b>What:</b><br>
								<br>
								A 1vs1 Galleon vs. Galleon competitive event, with the intention to offer a fair and balanced playing field to everyone, and to "stimulate fun behavior" while giving a different gameplay experience than RegularWake(vanilla Blackwake) or TournamentWake(previous community Tournaments).<br>
								<br>
								<b>Date:</b><br>
								<br>
								8th September 2019 – 29th September 2019 (all matches must be played during this time period; any deviation from this timeline must be agreed upon by all participants).<br>
								<br>
								<b>Time:</b><br>
								<br>
								Time for each individual match will be discussed and agreed upon by Team Leaders at a later date.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Server/s:</b><br>
								<br>
								“BalanceWake Tournament” ("Drunkwake" renamed and reconfigured for the duration of the event).
								<br>
								<b>Participants:</b>
								<br>
								Officially open for team sign-ups. Sign-ups deadline 1st September 2019.<br>
								<br>
								Moderator/s:<br>
								<br>
								E X T R A T H I C C#4983<br>
								<br>
								Caster/s:<br>
								<br>
								miggy#2186<br>
								<br>
								<b>Sign-ups:</b><br>
								<br>
								Please prior to signing-up, read carefully the event’s format and rules down below. When that is out of the way:<br>
								<br>
								Team Leaders need to send a message to Yellow #2156 on Discord with their Team Names and the name and steam profile-link of each of their individual team members.<br>
								<br>
								Alternatively they can sign-up via the Competitive Council Discord. <a href="https://discord.gg/QtCXn2k">https://discord.gg/QtCXn2k</a> and follow the instructions there.<br>
								<br>
								<b>1st place reward:</b><br>
								<br>
								150 EUR (divided as agreed upon by the whole crew) (suggestion: 30 EUR to captain, 10 EUR to each crew member).<br>
								<br>
								<b>Format:</b><br>
								<br>
								- 1 ship vs. 1 ship (large crew Galleon vs. Galleon only).<br>
								<br>
								- TDM First team to either sinks 3 times during a match or run out of tickets loses the match (this includes sinking by abandoning ship or sinking by losing a grapple).<br>
								<br>
								- If the timer goes down to 0 without nobody reaching the 3 sinks limit, then the team who has sank the most, loses the match.<br>
								<br>
								- In the case of it being an even amount of sinks for both teams by timer end, the team with less tickets remaining loses the match (sinks take precedent over tickets count).<br>
								<br>
								- Any crew/community/clan consisting of at least 13 or more players is eligible to join regardless of nationality/region and of rank/level.<br>
								<br>
								- Any crew/community/clan that has enough players to fill several teams, is allowed to do so, as long as none of the members of the different teams overlap (no player is allowed to participate in the tournament representing more than 1 team).<br>
								<br>
								- An standard and randomized Round Robin Bracket System will be used to set up teams against each other. After all teams have played eachother, the team with the most acumulated wins is chosen as champion.<br>
								<br>
								- In the case of there being a tie on the amount of wins, then a vote shall be held to either divide the price money between the tie-winners, or force the tied teams to play a tiebreaker match.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Rules:</b><br>
								<br>
								- Following server options shall be ON: GlobalVoice, friendlyFire, friendlyShipDamage, friendlyPlayerCollision, friendlySpreadFires.<br>
								<br>
								-All matches shall be played on Clear/Sunny weather.<br>
								<br>
								-All matches shall be played on Tortuga (if the map gets fixed on time), or otherwise played on any random map (with exception of the maps mentioned below).<br>
								<br>
								- Following maps are not allowed: Ice, Water Spout, Volcano.<br>
								<br>
								- Following weapons are not allowed: Handmortar, Axe.<br>
								<br>
								- Following special items are not allowed: Tomahawk<br>
								<br>
								- Following shot types are not allowed: Barshot.<br>
								<br>
								- On each initial engagement (each time one spawns/respawns) both team must advance until they are at 500m range (or less) from each other (calculated from the ship’s wheel) before turning their broadside.<br>
								<br>
								The following “exploits” are not allowed:<br>
								<br>
								- Third party crosshair NOT allowed.<br>
								<br>
								- Hiding in inaccessible parts of the ship not allowed.<br>
								<br>
								- Intentionally having fewer players to speed up ship tasks not allowed.<br>
								<br>
								- Abusing team switching in any way not allowed.<br>
								<br>
								- Intentionally insta-releasing grapples not allowed.<br>
								<br>
								The following “small exploits” are allowed (as they sometimes happen naturally and unintentionally):<br>
								<br>
								- Insta-heal (repair hole with rum/tea).<br>
								<br>
								- Supply glitch (it duplicates when you put it down fast enough).<br>
								<br>
								- Decoy Captains (not seen as an exploit but rather a valid strategy).<br>
								<br>
								<b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
								<br>
								- When a date and time for a match between two teams has been agreed upon, a maximum delay of 15 minutes is allowed; otherwise the team responsible for the delay forfeits the match. Exceptions can only be made if both participating teams agree upon it.<br>
								<br>
								- Each participating team must make sure that a minimum amount of 10 registered team members show up in time (max delay included) for the match or otherwise they will forfeit the match.<br>
								<br>
								- In the case of several matches taking place back to back during the same day, the next match on queue has to start max 30 minutes after the previous match is over. Failure to do so will see the team responsible for the delay forfeits the match. Exceptions can only be made if both participating teams agree upon it.<br>
								<br>
								- The event Server/s shall be online and properly set up at least 1h prior to the match start time.<br>
								<br>
								<b>Things to remember:</b><br>
								<br>
								- The event’s rules and format will be actively enforced by Moderators and/or Casters. Teams will be faced with an automatic loss of the round if spotted intentionally breaking any of them.<br>
								<br>
								- We are here first and foremost to have fun, thus good sportsmanship is expected at all times. If you feel you can’t do this without “issues” please be reasonable and don't enter the event.<br>
								<br>
								- Your matches are being casted! Any bad behavior will reflect badly not only on you and your team, but also on the whole game in general and its community. Set a good example.<br>
								<br>
								- Putting together (organizing, moderating, casting and even sponsoring) a “tournament” are all hard things to archive, so is gathering a full crew to participate on it. Remember the fact and please show respect and encouragement to everybody involved.<br>
								<br>
								<b>DISCLAIMER:</b><br>
								<br>
								Any and all of the above information might be subject to changes and/or be updated as time passes, so make sure to stay frosty and up to date.<br>
