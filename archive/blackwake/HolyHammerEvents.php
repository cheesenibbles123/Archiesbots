								 - 4th April 2020<br>

								<br>
								Fighting Zone:<br>
								 - The only zone where you are allowed to be is on the docks (between the gate and the ships)<br>
								 - Rocks, inside of the fort, on-board the ships are all off-limits (unless you have died and are awaiting round end)<br>
								<br>
								Rules:<br>
								 - Only weapon allowed is the pike<br>
								 - Teams will be randomly filled in as people join<br>
								 - Game mode is Siege (the siege fort is best suited for this we believe as there is less running around here than on the CTB island)<br>
								<br>
								Will consist of two teams:<br>
								 - Team A (navy) will start at the top of the docks just in front of the gate<br>
								 - Team B (pirates) start at the bottom of the docks at the carts<br>
								<br>
								After you die, no returning to the fight, navy dead stay inside the fort, pirate dead stay on the ships until the round is over<br>
								<br>
								No Cannons, Mortars or swivels may be fired<br>
								<br>
								A fight will be a best of 3<br>
								<br>
								navy and pirates will fight TDM style against each other with the pikes<br>
								<br>
								To win a round you must eliminate all enemy players<br>
								<br>
