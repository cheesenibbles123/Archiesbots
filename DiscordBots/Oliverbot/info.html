            Hey! If you're here, they you're likley wondering what exactly is <b>Oliverbot</b>? Well, the answer is both simple, and complex, so let us begin.<br>
            <br>
            Oliverbot is a Discord bot with lots of functionality built in to it. Here is a small list that coveres some of it's capabilities:

            <ul class="listNoBullet">

                  <details>
                     <summary>Economy System</summary>
                     The economy system is constantly evolving and changing as parts are reworked to a final setup, it is getting close to this, however it is still very much <b>WIP</b>. The final design will have the following (but not be limited to):

                     Income Generation:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Run the work command once every day
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Small random amount based off activity within the server
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                     Purchasing:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Raw materials that can be used to craft items with
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Tools to work materials with
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Buildings to allow more complex items to be crafted
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Sources of passive income/generation (when managed well, if managed poorly these may drain your account)
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                     Crafting:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           Combining resources into more advanced and higher valued items
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Buildings and tools to create higher quality, and better items
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Some of these items can be used on the rankcard, and wallet card as a showcase
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                  <details>
                     <summary>Dynamic command reloading</summary>
                     This means that a command can be edited, and then reloaded whilst the bot is still running. This allows quick and easy fixing of bugs and issues found when a new command is added, or an issue with an older command has arisen.

                     <summary>Game Integration</summary>
                     Oliverbot currently allows players to view their game statistics through their respective commands, currently two games are supported and both are access through the steamAPI.
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/" style="color: black;">Payday 2</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420290/Blackwake/" style="color: black;">Blackwake</a>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     This allows individuals to converse with their friends, and show off their achievements to others from the comfort of their chair.

               <li>
                  <details>
                     <summary>Recursive command loading</summary>
                     Command, Event, Startup and Interaction loading is done recursively through the folders. This means that, as an example, you could use any from of folder structure within the commands folder, without having to change any filepaths or risk a command not being found. This allows easy creation and addition of new events, interactions etc as long as they are structured correctly.

                     <summary>User Interactions</summary>
                     By default there are several random reaction/repsonse systems built into oliverbot. It will look for certain keytwords in the messages sent, and randomly (with a low % chance to prevent spam)react with a given emoji, or post a gif relating to the conversation.

                     <summary>XP System</summary>
                     The leveling system is fairly simple, you gain a small amount of xp for every message you send (with a slight delay requirement to prevent it being abused too easily). After your each enough XP you will level up to the next level, each following level will require more and more xp to achieve. Your level and xp can be show on your Rank Card that is customizable for each individual.
